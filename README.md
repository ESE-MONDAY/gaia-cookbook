# Gaia Cookbook üç≥üå±

Welcome to the Gaia Cookbook! This repository is a collection of practical examples, code snippets, and mini-projects demonstrating how to use **Gaia** effectively with Python or JavaScript.

Whether you're just getting started with Gaia or looking for specific patterns and best practices, this cookbook aims to provide you with clear, concise, and runnable examples.

## üåü What is Gaia?

Gaia is a decentralized computing infrastructure that enables everyone to create, deploy, scale, and monetize their own AI agents that reflect their styles, values, knowledge, and expertise.

It allows individuals and businesses to create AI agents. Each Gaia node provides:

    - a web-based chatbot UI
    - an OpenAI compatible API.

100% of today's AI agents are applications in the OpenAI ecosystem. With our API approach, Gaia is an alternative to OpenAI. Each Gaia node has the ability to be customized with a fine-tuned model supplemented by domain knowledge which eliminates the generic responses many have come to expect. For example, a Gaia node for a financial analyst agent can write SQL code to query SEC 10K filings to respond to user questions.

Similar Gaia nodes are organized into Gaia domains, to provide stable services by load balancing across the nodes. Gaia domains have public-facing URLs and promote agent services to their communities. When a user or an agent app sends an API request to the domain's API endpoint URL, the domain is responsible for directing the request to a node that is ready.

## üéØ Goals of this Cookbook

*   **Practical Examples:** Provide ready-to-use code for common tasks and use-cases.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Offer solutions in both Python and Node.js where applicable.
*   **Quick Start:** Help developers get up and running with Gaia features quickly.
*   **Best Practices:** Showcase efficient and recommended ways to interact with Gaia.
*   **Community Driven:** Encourage contributions to expand the collection of recipes.
